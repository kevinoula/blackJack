# Blackjack Game
Creating a Blackjack CLI game as my first Golang project to learn this language.

## Installation
### MacOS
1. Run this command in your terminal to download the binary `curl -L -o ${HOME}/Downloads/blackjack https://github.com/kevinoula/blackjack/releases/latest/download/blackjack` or with your Github token `curl -L -H "Authorization: token ${GITHUB_TOKEN}" -o ${HOME}/Downloads/blackjack https://github.com/kevinoula/blackjack/releases/latest/download/blackjack`
2. Move it to your binaries `mv ${HOME}/Downloads/blackjack /usr/local/bin/blackjack`
3. Allow it file permissions to run `chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/blackjack`
4. Type `blackjack` in your terminal to execute. You may need to adjust your Mac settings to trust
